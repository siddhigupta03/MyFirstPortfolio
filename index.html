        <p>They can go for weeks without drinking water. The ability of the camels to stay for weeks without having to drink water led to them being nicknamed “ships of the desert.”
            They store fat in parts of their bodies known as humps. Camels possess either one or two humps that are located on their backs. These humps exist for purposes of storing fats that the camels utilize for nourishment during the famine.
            They can live for about 40 years. The life span of camels is 40 years. The young ones are born white in complexion. However, as they keep growing they grow brown skin.
            Humps act as heat regulators for camels. During high temperatures in the desert, fatty acids stored within the camels’ humps minimize heat insulation leading to rising in the body temperatures to equal that of the environment.
